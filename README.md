With Bootstrap, we ensure a responsive and visually appealing design that adapts to various devices, making it easy for users to browse and purchase gaming products. Flask, a lightweight Python web framework, handles the back-end operations, including user authentication, cart management, and order processing. MongoDB serves as the database system, storing product information, user data, and order history.
